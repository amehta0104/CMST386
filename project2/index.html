    1.	Client and Topic (25-word minimum):
Which of the following describes the website you will be creating? website (you must seek instructor approval).

2.	Development Process and Engagement (50-word minimum):
o	I am making this website for my mom’s home baking store. She will be selling baked goods and ice cream to locals. We will not deliver these goods so the only option is to place an order, decide date and time for pickup, and then come to the house to pick it up. We do not want to be responsible for mishandling of goods or expiring goods. 
3.	Testing (50-word minimum):
o	For testing, we ill gather around 10 friends and family, and have them order different items through our online store and set different dates and times for pickup. We will also test our notification system, so that we never miss an order. We will make sure the notifications have the items they want, the quantity, and the date and time for pickup on the notification ticket. We will also be testing certain layouts and menu listing on the website with the family members and friends. We will test the site on chrome, IE, Safari, Firefox, and Opera Browser.
4.	Description (100-word minimum):
o	The business is a homemade baking store with pickup options only. The goal of the website for the business is to allow another avenue of placing orders. Previously, we were only taking phone orders from people that knew my mother. But over time, as the word about her baking good around, more people wanted to place orders, but had no way of contacting us, ( friend’s friend or 3rd cousin – we don’t give out our phone numbers to strangers.; on that note however, if business continues to grow, we will get a separate landline for the business) . The target audience is anyone in the DMV area ( as long as you can drive to us, you can place an order.)
5.	Growth and Maintenance (50-word minimum):
o	We plan on releasing new items every 4 months (including all seasonal items) . So, the website will, at the very least, get updated every four months. Besides new items, my mom was considering having a recipes tab in the future, so once that is added to the website, perhaps once a month.
6.	Organization (100-word minimum):
o	How will the website content be organized?
o	What sub-topics will the website include?
o	What pages will be included in the website?

	Include wireframes of the home page and one interior page. Here are two online tools that make help: https://www.justinmind.com/free-wireframing-tool -or-

	Develop a storyboard, website map, diagram or flow chart to show the webpages of Project 4, how the pages are related to each other and the flow of the site.
	Not sure where to start? Students can use PowerPoint or any other application at their disposal. Here are three online tools that make it easy: http://www.diagram.ly/-or- http://www.gliffy.com – or – http://www.draw.io.
7.	Security (50-word minimum):
o	The website will be an ecommerce site. Not everything will be password protected; we will allow anyone to browse the site and look at our products. , but in order to actually place an order, you will need to create an account on our site. We will also have an option to pay with PayPal. 
8.	Web Hosting (100-word minimum):Please note that you aren't required to actually register a domain name or sign up for a hosting plan
o	The criteria for picking a web host are as follows : 1) we need a host that will allows us to start on a smaller hosting plan and also has options to scale up with the business. 2) We also need a host that has live support (doesn’t need to be 24/7) # ) we need a host that allows us to setup[ a business email on the server, and that also has a front end email client. 4) We need a host with ecommerce support / features.
o	
o	I would to have the domain “RomasBakery.com” or something very similar because it’s a short , unique, roll off the tongue name. On top of that, it is also my mothers name and it clearly conveys what we sell ; baked goods.
9.	Marketing (50-word minimum):
o	The website will initial be marketed on social media using local radius filters. We noticed the majority of our customers were middle aged moms with kids, so our social media campaign will revolve around the ages of 25-60 (including new mothers and grandparents.) This business is more of an at home catering business, rather than a sit-down shop, so we noticed less young adults and older people ordering from us. We would also like to start campaigning for local business events to be catered from us. We will also be putting up one-page flyers in surrounding neighborhoods, and local grocery stores to maximize our reach.
