        <h2> Explain the ways to implement preprocessing

        </h2>

        <p>

            Client-side pre-processing is intended as the task of transforming some content
             or style file before it is actually added to the DOM.

        </p>

        <h3> Implementation</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>The first step is downloading the raw (unprocessed) resource. </li>
            <li>Then we can process and transform the raw data. </li>
            <li> Finally the result can be added to the DOM</li>
        </ul>

        <p> These steps can be implemented with VanillaJS by making an AJAX request, the old way,
             or by using the modern fetch method.</p>
